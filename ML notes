ML notes
========
Regression task: output being predicted is a real number.
Classification task: fixed set of classes

Subtleties that are small to the human eye are not very small to NNs. (e.g. classifying 200 breeds of dog is an easy task)

Regression tends to be harder than classification (especially if you're trying to predict many things)

For a robust system, feed in many types / subclasses of input for a given class. (e.g. different depths of combinator, different directions for image dithering)

Architectures:
	Go to Neural Net repository, download [image training / recurrent neural net etc]
